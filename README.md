# coursework
This repository contains some of the coursework I completed during my undergrad. 

Some highlights are:

--an simulated least recently used (LRU) replacement cache written in C
--a simulation of a hypercube routing network written in Go
--implementations of queues, binary search trees, sorting algorithms and a black jack game
